Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Wei Rong, an incoming penultimate computer science student minoring in [innovation & design programme (iDP)](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/edic/idp/) at NUS. My username wr1159, comes from my initials (WR) and a 4 digit number i like (1159).

I love Software Engineering and other forms of engineering as it allows me to create solutions whenever I think, "If only there was something...".  I particularly enjoy the blockchain space because of the constant innovation to capture the attention economy. 

I like playing the [Otamatone](https://otamatone.com/), posting on LinkedIn for fun. 

Feel free to take a look at my past projects at [wr1159.github.io/](https://wr1159.github.io/)
